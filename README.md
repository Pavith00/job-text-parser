Job Criteria Information Extraction with spaCy
This project uses spaCy, a powerful natural language processing (NLP) library, to extract essential information from job criteria provided in natural language format. The goal is to automate the extraction of key data points like required skills, qualifications, experience, and more from job descriptions. This makes it easier to match job requirements with candidate profiles for eligibility filtering or recruitment processes.

Overview
In job descriptions, qualifications, required skills, experience, and other criteria are often mentioned in unstructured text. This project builds a model using spaCy to extract important data points from this text and turn it into a structured format. By doing so, this system enables better analysis and matching of candidates to job criteria.

The primary use case for this project is automating the extraction of key information from job descriptions, making it easier to analyze and match applicants' qualifications against specific job requirements.

Why spaCy?
spaCy is a leading open-source library for natural language processing (NLP). It's fast, efficient, and easy to use for text analysis tasks, making it a perfect choice for extracting structured data from unstructured text like job descriptions.

Why spaCy?

Pre-trained models: spaCy provides pre-trained models for various languages, making it easy to apply NLP techniques like part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition (NER), and dependency parsing.
Entity Recognition: spaCy excels at named entity recognition (NER), which allows the model to identify key pieces of information such as dates, qualifications, skills, and experience mentioned in the job descriptions.
Customizable: It allows easy customization and extension to fine-tune models for specific tasks (like extracting specific job-related criteria).
Efficient Processing: spaCy is optimized for speed and large-scale text processing, making it ideal for real-world applications like job description extraction.
How spaCy is Used in This Project
In this project, spaCy is primarily used for named entity recognition (NER) to identify key pieces of information from job descriptions. For instance, the model is trained to identify and extract entities such as:

Qualifications: e.g., "Bachelor's degree in Computer Science"
Experience: e.g., "5 years of experience"
Skills: e.g., "proficiency in Python"
Age criteria: e.g., "must be between 25 and 40 years old"
Key Steps in Using spaCy:
Loading Pre-trained Models: We load spaCy's pre-trained language models to process and analyze job criteria text.
Text Processing: The input job description text is passed through spaCy's NLP pipeline, which applies tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing.
Named Entity Recognition (NER): spaCy's NER is used to detect and classify entities such as dates, skills, qualifications, and experience from the text.
Custom Rules: You can extend the default entity recognition by adding custom rules tailored to specific job descriptions or criteria (e.g., extracting skill sets or required qualifications).
Output Structured Data: The extracted entities are then formatted into structured data, which can be used for filtering or analyzing candidates based on job requirements.
Code Explanation
Here's an overview of how the code works:

Importing spaCy:

python
Copy code
import spacy
We import spaCy to use its built-in functions for NLP tasks like tokenization, NER, and text processing.

Loading the spaCy Model:

python
Copy code
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
We load a pre-trained English model (en_core_web_sm) which is optimized for general NLP tasks. It comes with pre-trained components for NER, POS tagging, and more.

Job Criteria Text Input:

python
Copy code
job_criteria_text = "The ideal candidate must have a minimum of 5 years of experience in software development, a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, and proficiency in Python and JavaScript."
This string contains the job criteria from which we want to extract relevant information.

Processing the Text:

python
Copy code
doc = nlp(job_criteria_text)
We process the job description text using spaCy's NLP pipeline, which breaks down the text into tokens, applies linguistic annotations, and detects entities like qualifications and skills.

Extracting Entities:

python
Copy code
for ent in doc.ents:
    print(ent.text, ent.label_)
This loops through the recognized entities (like "5 years of experience" or "Bachelor's degree in Computer Science") and prints the entity's text and its label (e.g., "EXPERIENCE" or "QUALIFICATION").

Customizing Entity Recognition
While spaCy's pre-trained models can identify standard entities, you might need to adjust the model for specific job-related criteria. For example, if your job descriptions often mention certain qualifications or skills, you can extend the model with custom entity labels for better extraction.

Example: Adding Custom Labels
You can train spaCy to recognize custom entities (e.g., "Skill" or "Experience"). Hereâ€™s how you might extend the NER model:

python
Copy code
# Add custom labels for "Skill" and "Experience"
from spacy.training import Example

# Example training data for custom labels
TRAINING_DATA = [
    ("The candidate should have 5 years of experience in Python.", {"entities": [(26, 32, "EXPERIENCE"), (41, 47, "SKILL")]}),
]

# Define the custom pipeline
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
ner = nlp.create_pipe("ner")
nlp.add_pipe("ner")

# Adding new labels
for label in ["EXPERIENCE", "SKILL"]:
    ner.add_label(label)

# Train the model with the new data
# (Refer to spaCy documentation for full training process)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/job-criteria-extraction.git
cd job-criteria-extraction
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the spaCy model:

bash
Copy code
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
Usage
Basic Extraction Example:

python
Copy code
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

# Example job criteria text
job_criteria_text = "The candidate must have at least 5 years of experience in Python and a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science."

# Process text through spaCy pipeline
doc = nlp(job_criteria_text)

# Extract and print named entities
for ent in doc.ents:
    print(ent.text, ent.label_)
Running the Model on a Dataset: If you have a file with multiple job descriptions, you can extract the criteria from each description using the extract_criteria() function.
